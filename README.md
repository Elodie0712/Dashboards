# TEA DASHBOARD IDEAS

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/256c2394-89b5-407d-a393-0a2780adf6be)

In this project, I created a dashboard to highlight 2017-2019 student performances using POWER BI and Dash.

## Power BI

_Disclaimer: I do not have the appropriate credentials to export the dashboards for users to manipulate._

### Dashboard Sections

- **[By Gender Tab](#by-gender-tab)**
